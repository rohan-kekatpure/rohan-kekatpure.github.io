### About the blog

Welcome to my site! This site is mostly meant to be a collection of personal notes on things related to coding and math.
The main motivation is elucidation of concepts that I've spent time developing into equations or code. Over time, I've
experienced several reasons to capture my thoughts into writing:
 
1. Writing forces a synthesis of concepts that is difficult for me to achieve when watching videos or even
reading. 

2. When encountering a concept for the second or the third time, I often wish that I had written my conclusions
 or code from the last time.
 
3. Written notes prove to be a fertile ground for finding new ideas, which often come in the form of extensions of
 previous ideas.
